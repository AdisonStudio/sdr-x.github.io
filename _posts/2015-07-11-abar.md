A HACKRF firmware to convert ADS-B (1090MHz) packet to BTLE (2.4GHz) packet. Let you use Phone/Pad to see plane around. (Such as LightBlue in APP store).

Two ways to try my firmware:

####1. try this firmware temporarily

(will lost after HACKRF reset. won't change HACKRF native firmware)

Download [adsb-btle-air-relay.dfu](https://github.com/sdr-x/sdr-x.github.io/blob/master/_resource/adsb-btle-air-relay.dfu) to local.

Download and install dfu-util:

    git clone git://gitorious.org/dfu-util/dfu-util.git

or here:

    git clone https://github.com/JiaoXianjun/ADS-B-BTLE-air-relay-HACKRF-firmware.git

To start up HackRF One in DFU mode, hold down the DFU button while powering it
on or while pressing and releasing the RESET button.  Release the DFU button
after the 3V3 LED illuminates.

Load the firmware to RAM and RUN:

    sudo dfu-util --device 1fc9:000c --alt 0 --download adsb-btle-air-relay.dfu

(After reset or power cycle you have to do dfu again because RAM content will lost after that.)

####2. flash this firmware into HACKRF permanently

(will change HACKRF native firmware. but you can restore HACKRF native firmware later)

####* restore HACKRF native firmware
