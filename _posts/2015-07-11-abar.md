A HACKRF firmware to convert ADS-B (1090MHz) packet to BTLE (2.4GHz) packet. Let you use Phone/Pad to see plane around. (Such as LightBlue in APP store).

Before you begin, take a look at firmware directory of [https://github.com/mossmann/hackrf](https://github.com/mossmann/hackrf)

Two ways to try:

####1. try this firmware temporarily

(will lost after HACKRF reset. won't change HACKRF native firmware)


####2. flash this firmware into HACKRF permanently

(will change HACKRF native firmware. but you can flash back later)

####*. flash HACKRF native firmware back
