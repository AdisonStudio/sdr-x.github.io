A HACKRF firmware to convert ADS-B (1090MHz) packet to BTLE (2.4GHz) packet. Let you use Phone/Pad to see plane around. (Such as LightBlue in APP store).

Two ways to try my firmware:

####1. try this firmware temporarily

(will lost after HACKRF reset. won't change HACKRF native firmware)

Download and install dfu-util:

  git clone git://gitorious.org/dfu-util/dfu-util.git

or here:

  git clone https://github.com/JiaoXianjun/ADS-B-BTLE-air-relay-HACKRF-firmware.git

####2. flash this firmware into HACKRF permanently

(will change HACKRF native firmware. but you can restore HACKRF native firmware later)

####* restore HACKRF native firmware
