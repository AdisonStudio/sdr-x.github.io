**All you need is a discovery board + a mini-usb cable to computer**

**CN3 connected mode: computer -- USB cable -- onboard STLINK -- onboard STM MCU**

**CN3 disconnected mode: computer --USB  cable -- onboard STLINK -- onboard CN2 -- offboard/other STM MCU**

**CN3 disconnected mode is not for offboard USB-STLINK programming discovery board via CN2!**
